# multi-label-multi-class-Dress-Classification
This project is more tutorial-followed because of the availability of the dataset in the tutorial, however some extra approaches and implementations will be done and have already been done to get an understanding of how to create a model that can give multiple labels as its predictions. The dataset and the tutorial can be inferred from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/07/multi-label-classification-with-keras/ .
A few touches are provided other than the original code, which show how the traditional metrics like precision, recall, f1-score, classification reports cannot be used for the evalutation of the model.
Some researches suggest that hamming loss and other approaches can be used for the evaluation, which I'll try sooner, hopefully.
